This repo contains a preconfigured Azure Kubernetes Service cluster embedded inside an hub-and-spoke network topology, aligned to the Azure enterprise-scale landing zone reference architecture, useful for testing and studying network configurations in a controlled, repeatable environment.

As bonus many scenarios with step-by-step solutions for studying and learning are also available.

The "playground" is composed by:
  * a hub and spoke network topologies aligned with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/architecture" target="_blank">Microsoft Enterprise scale landing zone</a> reference architecture
  * an AKS cluster deployed in one spoke
  * routing table(s) and firewall policy configured so that all the AKS outbound traffic is routed through the firewall

# Deploy to Azure

You can use the following button to deploy the demo to your Azure subscription:

# Architecture

This diagram shows a detailed version with also all subnets, virtual machines, NVAs, IPs and Firewalls.

![hub and spoke](images/architecture-h-and-s.png)

the ARM template [xxx](hub-01-bicep/xxx.json) deploys:

* 4 Azure Virtual Networks:
    * `hub-lab-net` with 4 subnets:
        * default subnet: this subnet is used to connect the hub-vm-01 machine
        * AzureFirewallSubet: this subnet is used by Azure Firewall
        * AzureBastionSubnet: this subnet is used bu Azure Bastion
        * GatewaySubnet: this subnet is used by Azure Gateway
    * `spoke-01` with 2 subnets 
    * `spoke-02` with 2 subnets 
    * `spoke-03` with 2 subnets and located in North Europe
* An Azure Firewall **premium** on the `hub-lab-net`  network
* `aks-01`: an Azure Kubernetes cluster deployed on a `spoke-01` subnet

## Playground's scenarios
Here there is a list of tested scenarios usable on this playground.

For each scenario you have:

* **prerequisites**: component to deploy required to implement the solution (only the hub, also one on-prem playground or both)
* **solution**: a step-by-step sequence to implement the solution
* **test solution**: a procedure to follow, to verify if the scenario is working as expected
